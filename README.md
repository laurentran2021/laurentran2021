### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**laurentran2021/laurentran2021** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

On Canvas, I attached a screenshot of my contact page which shows a "contact me" form that does not show up on my GitHub page. 
I used an iframe to embed a google form because the best way for people to contact me is through my email and this form sends me responses to my inbox.
