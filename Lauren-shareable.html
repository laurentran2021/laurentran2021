            <p class="shareable-description">Our project centered on using automated scoring and crowdsourcing to help journalists fact check the Congressional Record. The Congressional Record, which is a record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress produced every day, can be anywhere from ten pages to well over one hundred pages. Our goal was to create a system that would find the sentences in the Congressional Record that may be important for journalists to fact check because it is time consuming to digest the entirety of the record. Our system pulls the ten claims that Claimbuster, in conjunction with Amazon MTurk workers, determined may be most important to verify.
